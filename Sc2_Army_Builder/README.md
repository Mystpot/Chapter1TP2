Sc2 Army Builder

Description and Background:

This program is an army builder application centered around the game Starcraft 2. I am going to use the games 3 races (Terran, Protoss, Zerg)
and the units from the races to create armies. You will be able to select units from the race you chose and create your army. Each army will
have a maximum size (Population cap). Units will have stats like attack damage, range, hit points, speed, armor and population cap consumed.
Units will also have strengths and weakness's vs other units.

Once you have build your army it will be given an army strength rating vs Air and vs Ground (Based on range of units) and you will be able to
compare to other armies created to see which army is stronger (Taking weakness's and strengths into account, not just army values)
